## Descriptive Statistics

Describes the data, e.g.:

- Measure of center: mean, median, mode
- Measure of spread: min, max, percentile, median, range (max - min), iqr (interquartile range) (q3 - q1), variance / std deviation
- Measure of shape: skewness / symmetry , 
- Outliers


## Inferential Statistics


Takes data to make predictions, uses terminology:

- Population, entire amount
- Sample, fraction of population
- Statistics, data / insight of Sample
- Parameter, the data / insight of the population (wanted)

Drawing conclusions based on statistics towards population >> inference. 


## Law of Large Numbers

The larger the sample size, the closer the statistics gets to the parameter.


## Central Limit Theorem

With a large enough sample size the sampling distribution of the mean will be normally distributed. (That means if you take many samples, you will reach the true mean more likely.)

## Bootstrapping

Instead of relying on CLT which has gaps (how big should the sample size be? Does it work for my statistic?), with bootstrapping we're simulating the sampling distribution.
